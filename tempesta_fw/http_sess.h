/**
 * HTTP session pinning.
 *
 * An HTTP session may be pinned to a server from main or backup group
 * according to a match rules defined in HTTP scheduler. But when live
 * reconfiguration happens, the next situations may appear:
 *
 * 1. Session pinning is switched to 'enable'. Nothing special, use general
 * scheduling routine to obtain target server and pin the session to it.
 *
 * 2. Session pinning is switched to 'disable'. Keep using pinned server until
 * session is expired. (Alternative: unpin sesion from a server and use generic
 * scheduling algorithm.)
 *
 * 3. A new server is added to main/backup group. New sessions will be
 * eventually pinned to the server.
 *
 * 4. A server is removed from main/backup group. Re-pin sessions of that
 * server to others using generic scheduling routine if allowed. Otherwise
 * mark the session as expired, since the pinned server instance will never
 * go up.
 *
 * 5. Main and backup group is removed from new configuration. Same as p. 4.
 *
 * 6. Main and backup group are no more interchangeable; according to the new
 * HTTP match rules sessions must be pinned to complitely other server groups.
 * This cases cannot be deduced during live reconfiguration, manual session
 * removing is required. End user should avoid such configurations.
